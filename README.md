# CS 131 MP2 - Chaos Problem
## By: Chua, Edrich Hans and Cantero, Rafael Miguel

Used Louise Gillian Bautista's implementation of Sys2ODEsRK4 and modified it to Sys3ODEsRK4 for system of 3 equations.

#### Files
* `ODE[1-3].java` - equations for dx, dy, and dz
* `Sys3ODEsRK4.java` - Implementation of RK4 on System of 3 linear equations
*  `Chaos.java` - main file where initial values are stored.

#### To run:
 * `javac Chaos.java`
 * `java Chaos`
 * You will see arrays for `t`, `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.

#### Things to do:
* Add 3D graphs
* Testing for multiple different init values and graphs as stated in the specs.
